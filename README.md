# Blade

![tests](https://github.com/surgiie/blade/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

An extended standalone version of the Laravel Blade engine so that it can be used on any textual file.

## Why?

There are several standalone blade engines out there, but there all meant for html files where spacing is not important.

I wanted the ability to use the blade engine for rendering template files such as yaml and wanted it to work basically on any textual file on the fly.

The blade engine trims output buffer and some compiled directives dont preserve nesting of the rendered content, for example, if you have a file like this:

```yaml
# example.yaml
name: {{ $name }}

    @include("partial.yaml")
```
Each line of the contents of the `@include` should also be indented by the number of spaces left of the `@include` directive, but it's not.

This is a problem, because the rendered result will not match the original file structure in terms of nesting/spacing, which is problematic when rendering files like `.yaml`

where nesting is semantically important.

## Installation

```bash
composer require surgiie/blade
```

### Use

```php
<?php

use Surgiie\Blade\Blade;
use Illuminate\Container\Container;

// set a cache directory for compiled cache files, defaults to vendor/surgiie/blade/.cache
Blade::setCachePath("/tmp/.blade");

$blade = new Blade(
    // pass optional container, defaults to: Container::getInstance() or new instance.
    container: new Container,
);

// then render any textual file by path and vars:
$contents = $blade->render("/path/to/file", ['var'=>'example']);
```

### Delete Cached Files
You can delete cached files using the `deleteCacheDirectory` method:


```php
Blade::deleteCacheDirectory();
```

**Tip** - Do this before calling `render` method to force render a file.


### Custom Directives

You can create a custom blade directive using the `directive` method:


```php
$blade = new Blade();

$blade->directive('echo', fn ($expression) => "<?php echo {$expression}; ?>");

$contents = $blade->render("/example.txt", ['name' => 'Surgiie', 'dogs'=>['luffy', 'zoro', 'sanji']]);
```
### Using Components

You may also use Blade `x-*` components in your file:

#### Anonymous Components

Using dot notation component tag names, you can specify a component file to render:

```html
<x-component.yaml data="Something" />
```

Where `component.yaml` resolves to the file `components/yaml` or `component.yaml` file that is relative to the file being rendered, this file can then contain any raw content and will be treated as a anonymous component.

**Absolute Paths**:
If you want to render a component file using absolute path, use a double dash instead of single dash after the `x` in tag name, i.e `x--` instead of `x-`:

```html
<x--components.foo.yaml data="Something" />
```
The above component will resolve to `/components/foo/yaml`, if that doesnt exist, resolves to `/components/foo.yaml` or errors out if either dont exist.

#### Class Components

Since this blade engine renders files on the fly, it does not know how to resolve class based components. In order to use class components you must specify component tag

names and component class to use using the `components` method:

```php
Blade::components([
    'components.example' => App\Components\Alert::class,
])

```
Then you can use the component in your file:
```html
<x-components.example data="Something" />
```

The engine, will then use the class to render the component.
